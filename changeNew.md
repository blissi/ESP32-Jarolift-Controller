Simply click on the version info in the bottom left corner, and a dialog will open. If a new version is available, you can initiate the update right there. It will automatically download and install the latest release from GitHub.

### 2. new option to enable/disable WIFI

there is a new option to enable/disable WiFi. This could be useful if you use the Ethernet connection and you do not want to use the WiFi in parallel.
The depending switch to enable/disable is also in Settings > WiFi

> [!CAUTION]
> Unfortunately after the update the "enable" will be false and therefore the Controller will be activate the "Setup-Mode" after restart, because WiFi and in most cases Ethernet is now disabled. Then you have to connect to the Accesspoint, go to Settings and activate WiFi. After Reboot everything should be fine again. Sorry, but that's something I can't avoid in this case.

> [!TIP]
> Maybe it is necessary to clean your browser cache after the update, to be sure that everything works well!
