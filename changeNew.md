# v1.5.0

## what's new

This update brings a cool new feature ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### 1. Timer Control

The timer function enables the automatic control of individual roller shutters or a selection of several roller shutters as a group.
A fixed time can be specified as a trigger, or sunrise or sunset with an optional time offset.
This controller can therefore also work well as a stand-alone solution without the need for further automation

The selection of roller shutters is supported by an additional dialogue. All configured and activated roller shutters are displayed there. These can be selected there and the bitmask is then automatically created from them.
