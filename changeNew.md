### WebUI-Demo

For a first impression of the functions and the WebUI, a limited demo is also available.  
This can be accessed via the following link: [WebUI-DEMO](https://dewenni.github.io/ESP32-Jarolift-Controller/)

### Changed condition for Setup-Mode

Setup mode is now activated when the ESP is restarted **5** times.
A maximum of 5 seconds may elapse after each restart.

Example: restart 1/5 - wait 2s - restart 2/5 - wait 2s - restart 3/5 - wait 2s - restart 4/5 - wait 2s - restart /5/5 => Setup-Mode
