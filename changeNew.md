### direct GitHub Update 🎉🎉🎉

This update introduces an exciting new feature: You can now update to the latest version directly from the WebUI – no need to download the .bin file manually anymore!

Simply click on the version info in the bottom left corner, and a dialog will open. If a new version is available, you can initiate the update right there. It will automatically download and install the latest release from GitHub.
