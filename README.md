# Getting started

## Platform-IO

The software is created with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [PlatformIO-Plugin](https://platformio.org).  
After installing the software you can clone the project from GitHub or you can download it as zip and open it in PlatformIO.
Then adapt the `upload_port` and corresponding settings in `platformio.ini` to your USB-to-serial Adapter and upload the code to the ESP.

> [!NOTE]
> Python must also be installed in order to fully compile the project. The scripts folder contains, for instance, scripts for creating the web pages that are called when the project is compiled.

## ESP-Flash-Tool

In the releases, you can find also the binary of the Software. If you don¬¥t want to use PlatformIO, you can also use the `esp32_jarolift_controller_flash_vx.x.x.bin` file and flash it directly on the ESP. This bin-file is already a merge with bootloader.bin, partitions.bin and the application.bin. You can flash this image an the ESP at address 0x00.  

**Windows**  
There are several tools available to flash binaries to the ESP.  
One of them is [espressif-flash-download-tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools)

**macOS/Linux**  
for Mac it is hard to find a tool with a graphical UI, but you can simple use the esptool.py:

1. open Terminal
2. install esptool: `pip install esptool`  
3. optional get the install path: `which esptool.py`  
4. set path: `export PATH="$PATH:/<path>/esptool.py"` (<- change <path> with result from 3.)
5. goto path where the bin file is located
6. get Device String: `ls /dev/tty* | grep usb` (use this in next Step for <UPLOAD-PORT>)
7. upload: `esptool.py -p <UPLOAD-PORT> write_flash 0x00 esp32_jarolift_controller_flash_vx.x.x.bin`  

## OTA-Updates

### local Web OTA-Update

The first option is, to download the ota Update File from the latest release at GitHub.
After you have downloaded this to your computer, you can perform a update with the embedded WebUI OTA-Update.
You can find the update function in the "Tools" Tab of the WebUI.

here you can choose "Firmware" and select the `esp32_jarolift_controller_ota_update_vx.x.x.bin` file from the release section

![ota-1](Doc/webUI_ota.gif)

### GitHub OTA-Update

since Version 1.4.0 it is also possible to update the controller directly in the WebUI without downloading the .bin file before.
If you click on the Version info on the bottom left, a dialog will open. If there is a new version available, you can directly initiate the update here. It will then automatically download and install the latest release from github!

![ota-2](Doc/github_ota.gif)

### PlatformIO OTA-Update

But it is also possible to download the software wireless with platformio.
You only have to change the `upload_port` settings in `platformio.ini`

There are two predefined Options:

- OPTION 1: direct cable upload
- OPTION 2: wireless OTA Update

## Setup Mode

There is a "Setup Mode" available. The "Setup Mode" is activated, when you press the "reset-button" of the ESP two times within 3 Seconds.
The "Setup Mode" will also activated if there is no wifi connection configured.

If the ESP goes into "Setup Mode", it will automatically create a own network access point with ssid  
üì∂ `"ESP32_Jarolift"`  
After you are connected to this network, you can open the webUI on ip-address  
**"<http://192.168.4.1>"**

## Configuration

Here you can setup all the configuration that fits to your heating system and your infrastructure.

- **WiFi**  
enter your WiFi credentials to connect the ESP to your network

- **Ethernet W5500**  
use Ethernet connection based on W5500 to connect the ESP to your network

- **Authentication**  
you can activate the authentication feature and configure user and password.

- **NTP Server**  
the ESP can connect to a NTP server to get the right Time information.
The default Time-Zone should fit if you are located in germany. Otherwise you can change it manually

- **MQTT**  
here you can activate the MQTT communication and enter mandatory parameters
All the parameters are mandatory!

- **GPIO**  
Here you can configure the GPIO to connect the CC1101 to the ESP32

- **Jarolift**  
here you have to configure some Jarolift specific protocol settings

- **Shutter**  
here you can configure each shutter with individual name

- **Group**  
here you can define optional shutter-groups

- **Language**  
There are two languages available. Choose what you prefer.
The language take effect on the webUI and also on the mqtt messages!

> [!NOTE]
> All settings are automatically saved when changes are made

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changes to GPIO or Jarolift settings require a restart!

![weubui-settings](Doc/webUI_settings.png)

## Filemanager

there is also a builtin file manager to open (show), download (export) and upload (import) the configuration file.
The configuration is stored in the ```config.json``` file. To backup and restore the configuration you can download and upload this file.

![filemanager](/Doc/webUI_tools.png)

## Migration

It is possible to migrate from a latest version of [madmartin/Jarolift_MQTT](https://github.com/madmartin/Jarolift_MQTT) to this project.

### Get a working Setup of this Project

- get a working version of this project up and running
- set the right GPIO settings for CC1101
- set the Master Keys
- set the Log-Level in the Logger of the WebUI to "Debug"

### Get the right serial number

- execute a shutter UP command of "old" Setup `(madmartin/Jarolift_MQTT)` for **channel 0!**.
- now you should see a debug message of this command in the Logger of the WebUI.  
It contains a message with `D (APP-JARO): (INF1) serial: 0xaabbcc00,`  
The first 6 digits are the serial number that you have to use for this project (in this example: **aabbcc**). this should be the same as configured in the WebUI of the "old" setup, but now we are sure to have the right one.
- set this serial in the WebUI of this project

### Get the right Device Counter

- read the actual device counter of the "old" setup from the System Page of the WebUI.
- set the same Device Counter value in the settings of this project.

### define the Shutter

- define the same shutter as in the "old" setup and activate them.

finished!  
now restart the ESP and test it.  
After restarting, first check whether the device counter has been read correctly from the EEPROM. Only continue testing if this is the case.
If everything done correct, all shutters should work like before. If not, some setting is wrong or you haven¬¥t used the latest version of `(madmartin/Jarolift_MQTT)`. In that case I would prefer to set a new Serial number, reset the Device Counter und learn the shutter again.

# MQTT

## additional information's (read only)

status information about WiFi:

```text
Topic: ESP32-Jarolift-Controller/wifi = {  
    "status":"online",  
    "rssi":"-50",  
    "signal":"90",  
    "ip":"192.168.1.1",  
    "date-time":"01.01.2022 - 10:20:30"  
}
```

## Commands

### Shutter

To control the shutters you can use the following mqtt commands.
{UP, OPEN, 0} means, that you can use one of the listed payload commands.

```text
command:    restart ESP
topic:      ../cmd/restart
payload:    none

command:    shutter up
topic:      ../cmd/shutter/1 ... cmd/shutter/16
payload:    {UP, OPEN, 0}

command:    shutter down
topic:      ../cmd/shutter/1 ... cmd/shutter/16
payload:    {DOWN, CLOSE, 1}

command:    shutter stop
topic:      ../cmd/shutter/1 ... cmd/shutter/16
payload:    {STOP, 2}

command:    shutter shade
topic:      ../cmd/shutter/1 ... cmd/shutter/16
payload:    {SHADE, 3}

```

### predefined Group

To control shutters a group you can use the following mqtt commands.
{UP, OPEN, 0} means, that you can use one of the listed payload commands.

```text

command:    group up
topic:      ../cmd/group/1 ... cmd/group/6
payload:    {UP, OPEN, 0}

command:    group down
topic:      ../cmd/group/1 ... cmd/group/6
payload:    {DOWN, CLOSE, 1}

command:    group stop
topic:      ../cmd/group/1 ... cmd/group/6
payload:    {STOP, 2}

command:    group shade
topic:      ../cmd/group/1 ... cmd/group/6
payload:    {SHADE, 3}

```

### Group with bitmask

You can also use a generic group command and provide the bitmask to select the shutters directly.  
The bitmask is a 16-bit number, with the least significant bit (on the right) representing channel 1.  
A set bit means that the channel belongs to this group.  

**Example**: `0000000000010101` means that channels 1, 3, and 5 belong to this group.

As payload, you can use three different formats to represent the same bitmask:

- **Binary**: `0b0000000000010101`
- **Hex**: `0x15`
- **Decimal**: `21`

```text

command:    group up
topic:      ../cmd/group/up
payload:    {0b0000000000010101, 0x15, 21}

command:    group down
topic:      ../cmd/group/down
payload:    {0b0000000000010101, 0x15, 21}

command:    group stop
topic:      ../cmd/group/stop
payload:    {0b0000000000010101, 0x15, 21}

command:    group shade
topic:      ../cmd/group/shade
payload:    {0b0000000000010101, 0x15, 21}

```


> [!NOTE]
> < ../ > is the placeholder for the MQTT topic which is specified in the settings.

## Home Assistant

MQTT discovery for Home Assistant makes it easy to get all values in Home Assistant.
The configured shutters will automatically visible as mqtt device in Home Assistant if HomeAssistant is enabled.

see also the official documentation: <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#discovery-messages>

<img src="Doc/webUI_ha2.png" alt="mqtt_ha1" width="75%">

In the mqtt settings you can activate the discovery function and also set the mqtt discovery topic and the device name for Home Assistant  
<img src="Doc/webUI_ha1.png" alt="mqtt_ha1" width="50%">

# Optional Communication

in addition to mqtt there are more communication options.

## WebUI-Logger

There is also a log function with which you can record various messages depending on the filter and display them via the WebUI. This can be useful for your own debugging and also for the further development of the software.

<img src="./Doc/webUI_Logger.png" width="75%">

## Telnet

In addition to the WebUI and MQTT, there is also a Telnet interface to communicate with the ESP.
The interface offers several commands to read out information and send commands.
An overview of the commands can be called up using the "help" command.
To connect, a simple Telnet connection can be started via the corresponding IP address of the ESP.

Example:

`> telnet 192.168.178.193`

<img src="./Doc/telnet.png" width="75%">
